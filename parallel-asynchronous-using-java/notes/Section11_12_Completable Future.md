- [] #Chapter 34 Introduction to Completable Future
  - ***CompletableFuture***
    - Introduced in Java8
    - CompletableFuture is an **Asynchronous Reactive Function Programming API**
    - Asynchronous Computations is a functional style
    - CompletableFutures API is created to solve the limitations of Future API
   
  - CompletableFuture and Reactive Programming
    - **Responsive:**
      - Fundamentally Asynchronous
      - Call returns immediately and the response will be sent when its available 
    - **Resilient:**
      - Exception or error won't crash the app or code
    - **Elastic:**
        - Asynchronous Computations normally run in a pool of threads
        - No of threads can go up or down based on the need
    - **Message Driven:**
        - Asynchronous computations interact with each through messages in a event-driven style
      
  - CompleatableFuture API
    - **Factory Methods:**
    - Initiate asynchronous computation
    - **Completion Stage Methods:**
        - Chain asynchronous computation
    - **Exception Methods:**
        - Handle Exceptions in an Asynchronous Computation
